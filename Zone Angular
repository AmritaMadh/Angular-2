ngZone:

Zone.js is used to detect when certain async operations occur to trigger a change detection cycle. 
Zone.js is an execution context that helps developers intercept and keep tracks of async operations.
Zone works with the concept of associating each operations with a zone. 
Each zone can fork(divide) and create child zone with diffrent context, no limits.
Inside a zone, async operations are captured using different APIs, so that the developer can decide what to do with the interceptions.



  SetTimeOut, SetInterval, Click, Addeventlist tener, xmlhttp request, keyUp, keyDown
Angular has its own way to handle Change Detection by using ngZone at its call. Compiler takes care of everything.
