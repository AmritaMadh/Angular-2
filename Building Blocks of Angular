Module : 
allow us to separate the functionality of our program into diffrent parts. These parts are independent of each other which means each modules outputs are completely separate form each other.
In angular modules allow us to group together other building blocks such as components, directives, pipes and services.
it also helps to minimize the code size by reuse.
it requires optional import oly once. this is called lazy loading meaning we can load any NG Module only on use. 
every angular application will have atleat one root module.
